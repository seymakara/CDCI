# Given an array nums and a value val, remove all instances of that value in-place and return the new length.

# Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

# The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.
