# Given a string s and a non-empty string p, find all the start indices of p's anagrams in s.

# Strings consists of lowercase English letters only and the length of both strings s and p will not be larger than 20,100.

# The order of output does not matter.

# Example 1:

# Input:
# s: "cbaebabacd" p: "abc"

# Output:
# [0, 6]

# Explanation:
# The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
# The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".

# ================= 
# PSEUDOCODE
# Hash the number of times each character appears in p. Iterate over s with a sliding window and maintain a similar hash. If these two hashes are ever the same, add that to the result.

# Each of the hashes have a finite (a-z, A-Z) number of possible characters, so the space used is O(1)

# We iterate over s linearly, comparing constant length hashes at each iteration so each iteration is also O(1), so the runtime is O(n)
