# Given an array of characters, compress it in-place.

# The length after compression must always be smaller than or equal to the original array.

# Every element of the array should be a character (not int) of length 1.

# After you are done modifying the input array in-place, return the new length of the array.


# Follow up:
# Could you solve it using only O(1) extra space?


# Example 1:
# Input:
# ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]

# Output:
# Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]

# Explanation:
# "aa" is replaced by "a2". "bb" is replaced by "b2". "ccc" is replaced by "c3".
