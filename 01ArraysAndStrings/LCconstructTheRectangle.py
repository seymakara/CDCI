# For a web developer, it is very important to know how to design a web page's size. So, given a specific rectangular web pageâ€™s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:

# 1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.

# 2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.

# 3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.
# You need to output the length L and the width W of the web page you designed in sequence.
# Example:
# Input: 4
# Output: [2, 2]
# Explanation: The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1]. 
# But according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3,  [4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2]. So the length L is 2, and the width W is 2.

class Solution(object):
    def constructRectangle(self, area):
        
        # to meet the requirements of point 3, getting closest to the center,
        # the square root will get as close as the center as possible
        mid = int(math.sqrt(area))
        
        # consider mid to be W here, and until you get to a point where there
        # are exact integers that will equate to a rectangle with area, subtract from mid/W
        # because point 2 states that L >= W
        while area % mid != 0:
            mid -= 1
        
        # compute L from W (mid), and W (mid)
        return [int(area/mid), mid]
